		Team Manipal Racing is the official off-road racing club of Manipal University. We design and fabricate All-Terrain Vehicles(ATVs) according to the rules laid by SAE BAJA.
        The three words “<strong>INNOVATE. INITIATE. INCARNATE</strong>” shape the work at Team Manipal Racing. We not only conceptualize ideas but also substantiate them into reality.
        TMR took up its first project at the SAE BAJA which was held in Wisconsin, USA. It was the first Indian team to qualify for the competition and one of the two teams representing Asia. The team stood at 14th position in design.
        After an overwhelming and successful first year, the team participated in SAE BAJA Rochester 2010. They were one of the 4 Asian teams to qualify. The team had to design and fabricate an amphibious vehicle. They finished at 62nd position which was the best finish by an Indian team ever.
        In 2012, the team participated in SAE BAJA Wisconsin. They were the 1st Indian team to qualify the technical inspection and scored 287/1000, which was the highest scored by an Asian team. They were the Best Indian Team for the 3rd consecutive year.
        In 2013, the team made its maiden performance at SAE BAJA India. They were awarded “2nd Safest Vehicle” award.
        In SAE BAJA India 2014, the V4 clocked 6.66 seconds making it the “4th fastest car” at the event.
        By implementing the concepts practically and competing at BAJA events worldwide, we are not only building off road cars but also creating real engineers and making the university and the nation proud.
